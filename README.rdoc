Welcome to MyHomeBank App Prototype

This goal of this app is to allow a parent to create a virtual home bank for his/her kid(s) as a tool to teach kids about finance (the power of compounding to start).

Kids will be able to make deposits or withdrawals to its account. All transactions must be approved by parent. Account balance will show the deposits and withdrawals and earned interest.
